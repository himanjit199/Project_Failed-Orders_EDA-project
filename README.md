## Introduction

This project aims to provide insights into Tesla's stock price movements by performing various time series analysis techniques. We will fetch historical stock data, preprocess it, and then apply rolling window calculations and resampling to extract meaningful statistics.

## Data Fetching

We use the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) from Yahoo Finance.

`import yfinance as yf`

# Data Preprocessing
The fetched data includes columns such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume'. We ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.

# Time Series Analysis
## Rolling Window Calculations
We perform rolling window calculations to compute statistics over a specified window of time.
## Resampling
We resample the data to calculate annual minimum values,mean and qurately and Business year (min,max,mean values).
# Visualization
We use matplotlib to visualize the data, making it easier to understand trends and patterns.
# Requirements
#### Python 3.x
#### yfinance library
#### pandas library
#### matplotlib library
# Usage
 `Clone the repository`.

 `Install the required libraries`.

 `Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to fetch the data and perform the analysis`.
 # Conclusion
This project provides a framework for analyzing stock price data using time series techniques. By fetching and preprocessing the data, and applying rolling window calculations and resampling, we can gain valuable insights into stock price movements over time.
